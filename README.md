## Slide Presentations

This repository includes functionality to create and export slide presentations from blog posts using [Slidev](https://sli.dev/).

### Creating Slides

1. Create a new slide presentation in the `slides/` directory (use `template.md` as a starting point)
2. Preview slides with: `npm run slides:dev -- slides/your-file.md`

### Exporting Slides

Slides are automatically exported as PowerPoint files in dark mode to the `assets/slides/` directory:

```bash
# Export slides to PowerPoint (PPTX) in dark mode
npm run slides:export -- slides/your-file.md
```

This will create a file at `assets/slides/your-file.pptx`.

### Options

To override the default settings:

```bash
# Export as PDF instead of PowerPoint
npm run slides:export -- slides/your-file.md --format pdf

# Export with light mode instead of dark mode
npm run slides:export -- slides/your-file.md --no-dark

# Specify a custom output filename
npm run slides:export -- slides/your-file.md --output=custom-name.pptx
```
