# How I Set Up This Blog with Claude and MCPs in 5 Minutes

Today I want to share a remarkable experience I just had. I set up this entire blog—from scratch to fully deployed on GitHub Pages—without writing a single line of code myself. The entire process took about 5 minutes of my time, compared to what would normally be a day-long project.

## The Traditional Blog Setup Process

If you've ever set up a blog before, you know the process typically involves:

1. Choosing a platform or framework (Jekyll, Hugo, WordPress, etc.)
2. Setting up a local development environment
3. Installing dependencies
4. Creating the site structure
5. Designing layouts and templates
6. Writing initial content
7. Setting up version control
8. Configuring a hosting solution
9. Deploying the site
10. Debugging inevitable issues

Even for someone familiar with the technologies, this could easily consume a full day or more.

## Enter Claude and Model-Controlled Processes (MCPs)

For this blog, I took a radically different approach. I used:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Anthropic's latest AI assistant model
- **Model-Controlled Processes (MCPs)** - Tools that allow Claude to execute code and commands

In a single conversation, I simply asked Claude to:
1. Create a new workspace for a blog
2. Initialize a GitHub repository
3. Set up Jekyll with a basic structure
4. Add sample content
5. Push everything to GitHub
6. Configure GitHub Pages for hosting

Claude handled everything—creating directories, writing configuration files, generating sample posts, initializing git, pushing to GitHub, and setting up the deployment workflow.

## Behind the Scenes

Here's what happened behind the scenes:

1. Claude used file system MCPs to create a workspace at `/Users/sid/Code/workspace_20250321_sid-said`
2. It generated all necessary Jekyll files (\_config.yml, layouts, etc.)
3. It wrote sample blog posts about my interests
4. It set up Git version control and created a GitHub repository
5. It configured GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
6. It resolved deployment issues by updating workflow files
7. It enabled GitHub Pages via the GitHub API

All of this happened automatically while I simply observed the process unfold.

## The Time-Saving Impact

What impressed me most was the time saved:

| Task | Traditional Method | With Claude & MCPs |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Environment setup | 1-2 hours | 30 seconds |
| Content structure | 2-3 hours | 1 minute |
| GitHub setup | 30 minutes | 30 seconds |
| Deployment config | 1-2 hours | 1 minute |
| Debugging | 1-3 hours | 2 minutes |
| **Total** | **6-10+ hours** | **~5 minutes** |

## Why This Matters

This experience demonstrates how AI assistants with the ability to execute code are fundamentally changing how we approach technical tasks:

1. **Accessibility**: You don't need technical expertise to set up sophisticated systems
2. **Speed**: Tasks that took hours or days now take minutes
3. **Quality**: The implementation follows best practices automatically
4. **Focus**: I could concentrate on the content and purpose rather than technical details

## Looking Forward

I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up. When technical implementation becomes this effortless, we can focus on what truly matters—the ideas, content, and value we want to share with the world.

This blog itself is a testament to how technology is making creative expression and knowledge sharing more accessible than ever before.

The most remarkable part? I wrote this post in Claude asking it to document how it created this blog, completing a perfect circle of AI-assisted content creation.
