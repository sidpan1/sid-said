# How I Set Up This Blog with Claude and MCPs in 5 Minutes

Today I want to share a remarkable experience I just had. I set up this entire blog—from scratch to fully deployed on GitHub Pages—without writing a single line of code myself. The entire process took about 5 minutes of my time, compared to what would normally be a day-long project.

## Breaking Through Years of Procrastination

For years, I've wanted to start a blog to share my thoughts on technology, AI, and software development. But every time I considered it, I'd get overwhelmed by the overhead involved:

- The technical setup process seemed daunting
- Maintaining the infrastructure would take time away from actually writing
- Keeping up with security updates and dependencies felt like a chore
- The thought of troubleshooting deployment issues gave me anxiety

This perpetual cycle of "I should start a blog... but it's so much work" kept me from sharing my ideas publicly. I'd start researching platforms, get bogged down in technical details, and eventually shelve the idea... again.

What I really wanted was to focus on writing and sharing ideas, not managing infrastructure. But the technical overhead always stood in my way—until now.

## The Traditional Blog Setup Process

If you've ever set up a blog before, you know the process typically involves:

1. Choosing a platform or framework (Jekyll, Hugo, WordPress, etc.)
2. Setting up a local development environment
3. Installing dependencies
4. Creating the site structure
5. Designing layouts and templates
6. Writing initial content
7. Setting up version control
8. Configuring a hosting solution
9. Deploying the site
10. Debugging inevitable issues

Even for someone familiar with the technologies, this could easily consume a full day or more.

## Enter Claude and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

For this blog, I took a radically different approach. I used:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Anthropic's latest AI assistant model
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - An open standard that enables AI models to execute real-world actions

The Model Context Protocol is what made this possible. MCP represents a significant advancement in how we interact with AI systems:

- It provides a standardized way for AI models to safely interact with external systems
- It allows models like Claude to execute functions in the real world—creating files, running commands, and interacting with APIs
- It defines a structured format for communication between AI models and the tools they control
- It builds in safety measures and permissions systems to ensure responsible use

You can learn more about MCP at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

In a single conversation, I simply asked Claude to:
1. Create a new workspace for a blog
2. Initialize a GitHub repository
3. Set up Jekyll with a basic structure
4. Add sample content
5. Push everything to GitHub
6. Configure GitHub Pages for hosting

Claude, powered by MCP, handled everything—creating directories, writing configuration files, generating sample posts, initializing git, pushing to GitHub, and setting up the deployment workflow.

## How MCP Made This Possible

The magic behind this automation lies in how MCP connects Claude to various capabilities:

1. **Filesystem Access**: Claude could create directories and files directly on my machine
2. **Shell Commands**: Claude could run git commands and other CLI tools
3. **GitHub API Integration**: Claude could create repositories and configure GitHub Pages
4. **Memory Persistence**: Claude could track what it was doing across multiple steps
5. **Error Handling**: When deployment initially failed, Claude could diagnose and fix the issues

Without MCP, Claude would only be able to generate code for me to run manually—effectively just giving me a tutorial to follow step by step. Instead, it could actually perform the actions directly, while I simply watched the magic happen.

## Behind the Scenes

Here's what happened behind the scenes:

1. Claude used file system MCPs to create a workspace at `/Users/sid/Code/workspace_20250321_sid-said`
2. It generated all necessary Jekyll files (\_config.yml, layouts, etc.)
3. It wrote sample blog posts about my interests
4. It set up Git version control and created a GitHub repository
5. It configured GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
6. It resolved deployment issues by updating workflow files
7. It enabled GitHub Pages via the GitHub API

All of this happened automatically while I simply observed the process unfold.

## The Time-Saving Impact

What impressed me most was the time saved:

| Task | Traditional Method | With Claude & MCP |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Environment setup | 1-2 hours | 30 seconds |
| Content structure | 2-3 hours | 1 minute |
| GitHub setup | 30 minutes | 30 seconds |
| Deployment config | 1-2 hours | 1 minute |
| Debugging | 1-3 hours | 2 minutes |
| **Total** | **6-10+ hours** | **~5 minutes** |

## Finally, Writing Without the Technical Burden

The most liberating aspect of this experience was realizing that I could now focus solely on writing. With Claude and MCP:

- The technical barrier to entry has virtually disappeared
- Maintenance becomes a simple matter of asking Claude to help with updates
- The complexity is abstracted away, but I still have full control
- I can expand and modify the blog without diving into Jekyll documentation

This solves exactly what kept me from blogging for years—the disconnect between wanting to share ideas and dreading the technical overhead. Now, I can just write.

## Why This Matters

This experience demonstrates how AI assistants with the ability to execute code through MCP are fundamentally changing how we approach technical tasks:

1. **Accessibility**: You don't need technical expertise to set up sophisticated systems
2. **Speed**: Tasks that took hours or days now take minutes
3. **Quality**: The implementation follows best practices automatically
4. **Focus**: I could concentrate on the content and purpose rather than technical details
5. **Procrastination Killer**: The biggest barrier to starting projects is now eliminated

The Model Context Protocol represents a new paradigm where AI systems can truly act as collaborative partners that handle implementation details while we focus on creative and strategic thinking.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited about the possibilities this opens up. When technical implementation becomes this effortless, we can focus on what truly matters—the ideas, content, and value we want to share with the world.

This blog itself is a testament to how technology is making creative expression and knowledge sharing more accessible than ever before. For anyone who has been putting off starting a blog or a similar project because of the technical overhead, I can only say: the wait is over.

The most remarkable part? I wrote this post in Claude asking it to document how it created this blog, completing a perfect circle of AI-assisted content creation.
