# Human-like Memory Objectives for AI Agents

One of the most significant challenges in building effective AI agents is context management. While large language models (LLMs) benefit tremendously from having extensive context, there's an inevitable trade-off: both latency and computational costs increase with context size.

## Understanding Context and Memory in LLMs

Before discussing solutions, let's understand how context works in LLM-based agents and why it presents such a challenge.

### What is Context in LLMs?

Context in LLMs refers to all the information available to the model when generating a response. This includes:

- The user's current query
- Previous messages in the conversation
- System prompts that guide the model's behavior
- Results from tool calls and external information sources
- The model's own generated thoughts and reasoning

Unlike traditional software with separate memory management systems, LLMs work with a single context window that contains everything they need to generate coherent responses.

### How Context Evolves During Interactions

The diagram below illustrates how context evolves during LLM interactions and how new information is created at each step:

#### Step-by-Step Context Growth

1. **Input Context**: When a user sends a query, it's combined with existing chat context to form the input for the LLM agent.

2. **Processing Stage**: Inside each processing step (as shown in Step 1 of the diagram):
   - The LLM receives the system prompt, tools list, and accumulated context
   - The agent generates thoughts and can make tool calls to external resources
   - Each tool call and its result adds new information to the step context
   - This process continues until the LLM determines it has a final answer

3. **Information Creation**: New information is generated in several ways:
   - **AI-generated thoughts**: The LLM's internal reasoning about the query
   - **Tool call results**: New data retrieved from external resources
   - **AI-generated answers**: The synthesized response based on all available information

4. **Context Accumulation**: With each interaction (moving from Step 1 to Step N), the context grows continuously as:
   - User queries accumulate
   - AI-generated thoughts and reasoning multiply
   - Tool call results add external information
   - Final answers become part of history

Without proper management, this growth becomes problematic for several reasons:
   - Context windows have hard limits (typically 32K to 128K tokens)
   - Processing costs increase with context size
   - Response latency increases with larger contexts
   - Information relevance can decrease as context becomes cluttered

## The Context Resource Challenge

Given how context naturally grows, we should view it as a resource - powerful but limited in quantity. Rather than manually managing this resource, what if we allowed LLMs to manage their own context intelligently? This approach would mimic how humans naturally manage memory and attention.

## Three Key Memory Processes

To implement human-like memory management, LLMs need to perform three essential functions:

### 1. Recall Historical Context
Like humans recalling relevant memories during a conversation, agents should regularly retrieve pertinent historical information. This is similar to how you might remember a previous conversation with a friend when they mention a topic you discussed weeks ago. This ensures continuity and coherence in interactions while keeping the immediate context focused only on what's relevant.

### 2. Index Current Context
Periodically, agents should organize and index new information they've encountered. Think of this as creating a mental filing system for new experiences. This is similar to how humans consolidate short-term memories into long-term storage through a process that happens in the background of our consciousness when we sleep.

### 3. Compress and Maintain Context Size
To prevent context bloat, agents need mechanisms to compress information and maintain manageable context sizes. This is like how you might remember the main points of a movie you watched last month, but not every line of dialogue. This mimics how humans remember the gist of conversations rather than verbatim transcripts.

## Implementation Approach

Let's look at a simplified implementation where the LLM itself controls when to access memory, similar to how humans choose when to search their own memories:

```python
# Define a memory store that can be indexed and searched
memory_store = MemoryStore()

# Define tools that the LLM can use
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="memory_search",
        description="Search for relevant memories when you need to recall past information",
        function=memory_store.search
    ),
    Tool(
        name="calculator",
        description="Perform mathematical calculations",
        function=calculate
    ),
    # Other tools the LLM might need...
]

# We maintain two separate stores of information:
# 1. chat_history - the permanent, complete record of all messages and interactions
# 2. context - the working memory that's actively used by the LLM (managed and summarized)
chat_history = ChatHistory()
context = Context()

# An LLM that can use tools and think to return a result
augmented_llm = AugmentedLLM(llm, SYSTEM_PROMPT, tools)

# Set up our main conversation function
def process_single_step(new_message):
    # Always append to chat history (this is never compressed or discarded) and context
    chat_history.append(new_message)
    context.append(new_message)

    final_answer = None
    
    # This is where the magic happens - the LLM decides what to do next
    while True:  # Continue until the LLM has a final answer
        # Ask the LLM to think and decide on next action
        result = augmented_llm.invoke(context)
        
        # The LLM might decide it has enough information to answer
        if result.has_final_answer:
            # Add the final answer to our permanent chat history and context
            chat_history.append(result.thoughts, result.final_answer)
            context.append(result.thoughts, result.final_answer)
    
            break
            
        # Or the LLM might decide it needs to use a tool (like memory_search)
        else:
            # The LLM chose to use a tool - track this in chat history and context
            chat_history.append(result.thoughts, result.action)
            context.append(result.thoughts, result.action)
            
            # Execute the chosen tool
            action_result = result.action.invoke()
            
            # Record the tool result in chat history and context
            chat_history.append(action_result)
            context.append(action_result)

    # Run the background memory management in a separate thread
    Thread.process(manage_context)

    # Return the final answer to the user
    return chat_history.new_messages()
```

```python
# Define a memory store that can be indexed and searched
memory_store = MemoryStore()

# Define tools that the LLM can use
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="memory_search",
        description="Search for relevant memories when you need to recall past information",
        function=memory_store.search
    ),
    Tool(
        name="memory_index",
        description="Index new information when you encounter it",
        function=memory_store.index
    ),
    # Other tools the LLM might need...
]

# An LLM that can index and search the memory store
memory_management_llm = AugmentedLLM(llm, MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_PROMPT, tools)

# Get a new context object
context = Context()

 # Clone the context to a temporary variable so we can modify it without affecting the original
temporary_context = context.clone()

# In a background thread, periodically process our growing context
def manage_context():
    # Only run when context exceeds a threshold
    if count_tokens(context) > TOKEN_LIMIT:
        while True:
            # Ask the LLM to think and decide on next action
            result = memory_management_llm.invoke(temporary_context)
            
            # If the LLM has a final answer, break out of the loop
            if result.has_final_answer:
                context.reset(result.final_answer)
                break
            else:
                # The LLM chose to use a tool, either to index or search the memory store
                temporary_context.append(result.thoughts, result.action)
                
                # Execute the chosen tool
                action_result = result.action.invoke()
                temporary_context.append(action_result)
```

This approach puts the LLM in control of when to access memory, while maintaining a clear separation between:

1. **Working Context**: The dynamic, managed memory that the LLM actively works with
2. **Chat History**: The permanent, complete record that is never summarized or truncated

This dual approach mimics how humans operate - we have our complete memories stored somewhere, but we only actively think about a relevant subset at any given time.

## Benefits and Implications

By implementing human-like memory management:

1. **Reduced Cost**: Only relevant context is processed in each interaction, saving computational resources and money. It's like only bringing necessary tools to a job instead of your entire toolbox.

2. **Improved Latency**: Smaller context windows mean faster responses. Just as you can answer a simple question faster than solving a complex puzzle, an AI with focused context can respond more quickly.

3. **Enhanced Relevance**: The system prioritizes information that matters to the current conversation. Like a good friend who remembers your preferences without you having to repeat them constantly.

4. **Scalability**: Long-running agents can maintain effectiveness without degradation. Similar to how experienced professionals can handle increasingly complex tasks without forgetting their core skills.

## Looking Forward

As we continue to develop more sophisticated AI systems, focusing on these human-like memory objectives could be key to creating agents that maintain coherent, contextual awareness across extended interactions while managing computational resources efficiently.

The future of AI agents may depend less on simply increasing context windows (like trying to remember everything at once) and more on developing intelligent systems for managing what goes into those windows in the first place (being selective about what's worth remembering).

## Human Memory in Action

Think about your own experience - you don't need to remember every detail of your life to have a meaningful conversation. Similarly, AI agents don't need unlimited context; they need smarter ways to manage the context they have.

By mimicking human memory processes, we can build AI systems that feel more natural to interact with while using computational resources more efficiently - getting the best of both worlds.
